I am a postdoctoral researcher at Örebro University and a member of both <a href='https://www.oru.se/english/our-profile/arc-ai-robotics-and-cybersecurity-center/'>the AI, Robotics and Cybersecurity Center (ARC)</a> and <a href='https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/aass/'>the Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems (AASS)</a>. In a broader sense, my research interests focus on robotics and robot learning, particularly the integration of machine learning, perception, and control for robotic manipulation across simulation and real-world settings.

My current research focuses on robot learning for sim-to-real manipulation and automation in challenging industrial environments, with example tasks such as cable routing.
During my PhD, supervised by Todor Stoyanov and Johannes A. Stork, I developed data-driven and learning-based methods for modeling and controlling deformable linear objects, including differentiable dynamics models, online model learning, and latent-space tracking. These work aimed to enable robots to better understand and manipulate complex, deformable objects in practical applications.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
